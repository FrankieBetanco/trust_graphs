Problem II
----------
[ ] Write code to identify a set of cross-sectional nodes between user (group) 
    graphs with respect to (a/an) attribute(s). 
[ ] Then, make it BFS and DFS traversable. 

Problem III
-----------
Write code to identify: 
[ ] Strongly-(trusted/untrusted)-components
[ ] Shortest-trust-path (single-source, single-destination)
[ ] Minimum-spanning-trust-tree

Deliverables
------------
-Source code, test inputs
-Report on data structures and algorithms
 -Overall Data Structure Description
 -Each data structure and algorithm description
 -Proposed (original) semi-sovereign identity management system under the 
  constraint of privacy and anonymity as studied in the assignment, and present
  a working demo
-Answer the following questions:
 -Symbolic definitoin of privacy and anonymity and its algorithm.
 -A new trust variable beyond PPAI.
 -How to guarantee trust history be kept confidential? Show algorithm.
